## Questions

### Which parts are you most proud of? Why?
I'm really happy with the time I took to properly plan the architure of the application before starting the implementation. It made the coding process a lot more straightforward and allowed me to make sure I was sticking to the brief (a concise, readable and correct application), while also following good coding practices.
### Where did you spend more time? What was the most difficult?
Implementing the redux store took the most time, purely because there's a lot of boilerplate involved and I haven't set one up from scratch in quite a while. But I'm glad I took the time to do this as I'm very happy with the way state is managed in the application.
### How did you find the test overall? Did you have issues or difficulties completing it?
I really enjoyed creating this project, I found it a good challenge of my coding skills and knowledge.
